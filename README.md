# Keel Example Project

## Todo App

This an example project for [Keel](https://keel.xyz), and gets auto-forked if you create a new Keel project with the example template.

[We have a full tutorial written for this example](https://keel.notaku.site/getting-started/tutorial) which you can follow along with to get started on your Keel journey!

### Project structure

- `/functions` This is where your custom and arbitrary functions live. These are generated initially by `keel generate` and then modified to suit your needs from there. Read more about them [here]()
- `/tests` Any tests you'll ruun with our testing suite live here. Read more about them [here]()
- `package.json` The standard project import tool
- `schema.keel` The Keel schema! Most of your work will take place here.
